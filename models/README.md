# Model registry format (draft, schema_version 2)

One YAML file per whitelisted model. Everything in this directory has been
reviewed and verified by the CHAP maintainers — a model, a new version pin, or
a new verified configuration only lands here through a pull request approved
by three maintainers. The marketplace site is a rendering of these files; the
repo stays the source of truth and the review gate.

`../registry.yaml` is the index: marketplace metadata, the review policy, and
the ordered list of model files.

This format is a first draft and expected to change. Bump `schema_version`
when it does.

## What schema_version 2 changed

Version 2 tracks chapkit 2.0.0. Every listed model is now a containerised
chapkit ML service rather than an MLproject repository run through chapkit's
MLproject runner, and the file records what the service's own `MLServiceInfo`
declares.

| v1 | v2 |
|---|---|
| `maturity: stable \| experimental` | `kind: model \| template` plus `assessed_status`, the author's own chapkit `AssessedStatus` |
| — | `service_id`, the id the service registers with chap-core under |
| `source.repository` (+ optional `mlproject_name`) | `source.repository`, `source.image`, `source.runtime_image` |
| — | `attribution` — author, organization, contact, citation, from the service metadata |
| `compatibility.max_prediction_length` | `compatibility.min_prediction_periods` / `max_prediction_periods` / `requires_geo` |
| `covariates.additional_continuous` | `covariates.defaults` plus `covariates.allow_free_additional` |
| `versions[].commit` | `versions[].commit`, `image_tag`, `chapkit` |
| `configurations[].user_option_values` (+ `additional_continuous_covariates`) | `configurations[].config`, the flat object chapkit takes on `POST /api/v1/configs` |

## Verification means the pin, not the forecast

Two separate signals live in every file, and the site keeps them apart:

- **`versions[].status` / `verified_by`** — the marketplace review gate. Three
  maintainers checked that the pin is the revision it claims to be and that it
  runs as a chapkit service. This says nothing about forecast quality.
- **`assessed_status`** — the *model authors'* own judgement, copied verbatim
  from the service's `MLServiceInfo.model_metadata.author_assessed_status`.
  The marketplace never assigns or reinterprets it.

`assessed_status` uses chapkit's `AssessedStatus` scale, whose definitions
come from chapkit itself (`src/chapkit/api/service_builder.py`):

| value | meaning |
|---|---|
| `green` | Validated and ready for production use. |
| `yellow` | Ready for more rigorous testing on diverse data. |
| `orange` | Shows promise on limited data; needs manual configuration and careful evaluation. |
| `red` | Highly experimental prototype, not validated; early experimentation only. |
| `gray` | Not intended for use — deprecated, or kept only for backwards compatibility. |

No listed model is currently self-assessed `green`.

## Models and templates

`kind: template` marks scaffolding — a repository whose whole purpose is to be
copied when writing a model, with a placeholder regressor where the real model
goes. Templates are listed because model authors need a reviewed, running
starting point, but they are counted, filtered and labelled separately from
forecasting models everywhere on the site, and must never be deployed to
produce real forecasts.

## Annotated example

```yaml

id: my_model                     # unique id, matches the filename
service_id: my-model             # MLServiceInfo.id — the kebab-case form of
                                 # `id`, enforced by the schema
display_name: My Model           # human-readable name for the catalog,
                                 # normalised — no "(chapkit)" suffix, no raw
                                 # repo names
kind: model                      # model | template
assessed_status: orange          # the AUTHOR's own AssessedStatus:
                                 #   green | yellow | orange | red | gray

## How the fields map to chapkit and chap

- A version pin resolves to two halves of one revision:
  `<source.repository>@<commit>` for reading the code, and
  `<source.image>:<image_tag>` for running it. The publish workflow tags every
  build `sha-<short commit>`, so a `sha-` tag must agree with `commit` —
  the schema enforces it. `:latest` moves and is never a pin.
- A listed service runs on one of chapkit's published base images
  ([dhis2-chap/chapkit-images](https://github.com/dhis2-chap/chapkit-images)),
  recorded as `source.runtime_image`: `chapkit-py` for Python services,
  `chapkit-r`, `chapkit-r-tidyverse` or `chapkit-r-inla` for R. The R-INLA
  base is amd64 only.
- Deployment is a compose overlay next to chap-core: the service self-registers
  through `SERVICEKIT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` on container port 8000, and the DHIS2
  Modeling App then picks it up automatically. A bare `docker run` registers
  nothing. See
  [chapkit's deployment guide](https://dhis2-chap.github.io/chapkit/guides/deploying-to-chap-core/).
- Every block under `configurations:` is the `data` object of a
  `POST /api/v1/configs` request — a running service holds no configuration
  until one is created. `prediction_periods` is required by chapkit's
  `BaseConfig` and validated here against the service's declared bounds;
  `additional_continuous_covariates` is the other field CHAP interprets.
- `covariates.required` are supplied automatically by chap and are therefore
  never repeated under `additional_continuous_covariates` in configurations.
- When `allow_free_additional` is `false`, a configuration may only name
  covariates from `covariates.defaults` — the service rejects anything else.

## Conventions

- `service_id` is `id` with underscores replaced by dashes. The schema
  enforces it so a listing cannot drift from the identity the service
  registers with chap-core, and the loader rejects two listings sharing one
  service id.
- `display_name` is normalised for the catalog: no `(chapkit)` suffix (every
  listed model is a chapkit service), and never a raw repository name.
- `channels.stable` must point at a version with `status: verified`.
- `maintainers` lists the GitHub handles responsible for the listing — not
  necessarily the model's authors, who are recorded under `attribution`. The
  current entries were backfilled from each source repository's contributors;
  corrections land like everything else, by PR.
- `versions[].verified_by` lists the three approving maintainers of the PR
  that added the pin. `[]` on a verified pin means the pin was verified by
  the merge gate itself without named approvals on record — true for the
  chapkit 2.0.0 seed import, which predates this repo's PR flow. Pins added
  by PR going forward record their approvers.
- `version` keys are the service's own `MLServiceInfo.version`; we do not
  rename them, the channel pointers provide the uniform interface.
- `changelog` is per-version, free text. `null` until we have one.

## Benchmarks

Benchmark results do not live in these files: they live in the sibling
[`../benchmarks/`](../benchmarks/README.md) directory, one YAML file per
(model, version, dataset), cross-checked against the pins here at build time.
None have been run yet, and how they will be run is still being decided.

## Open questions for this draft

- Is per-model `assessed_status` the right granularity, or should it be
  per-version like `status`?
- Do dataset-specific configuration bundles stay a separate concept, or are
  verified per-model configurations enough?
- Should a `yanked` image tag be recorded distinctly from a yanked commit,
  given a registry deletion and a git revert are different events?
